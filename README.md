<h3>How I approached the task</h3>
<p> First created react project with Gitbash. Then made imports For google fonts and icons, then made folder structure for Components Ex. navbar,home..etc. <br/>
Then firstlt made sure that all my components are imported in App.js and all of them are linked to their repected styleSheets. Then I wrote code for Navbar then same for  the left sides of the screen which is Usercount and Earnings Panel. Then onto the main Home screen where Tooltips are available for diffrent citys of the worlds with arrrows pointed downward coding this was challenging. Completed this with making liked div's to obtain the given Style.
